# Defense Strategy Simulation: A Game-Theoretic Approach

## Overview
This Python-based project is a strategic simulation inspired by scenarios from the defense industry. Players engage in rounds of decision-making, choosing from attack, defense, and diplomacy strategies. The simulation uses a game-theoretic approach to calculate outcomes and determine the most effective strategies.

## Features
- Interactive gameplay with dynamic strategy selection.
- Three core strategies: **Attack**, **Defend**, and **Diplomacy**.
- Real-time scoring and feedback after each round.
- Total scores calculated at the end to determine the winner.
- Fully customizable for more advanced scenarios.

## How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. For each round, choose one of the available strategies:
   - **1:** Attack
   - **2:** Defend
   - **3:** Diplomacy
   - **4:** RandomStrategy
3. The opponentâ€™s strategy will be randomly chosen.
4. At the end of 5 rounds, the final scores are displayed, and the winner is announced.
